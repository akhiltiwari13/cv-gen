## 1. C++ Experience in Financial Services & Trading Platforms

### **My C++ Journey in Financial Services**

I have over **10 years of extensive C++ experience** specifically in financial services, where I've used modern C++ (C++14/17/20) as my primary language for building mission-critical trading infrastructure across multiple tier-1 institutions.

**At AlgoQuant (2024-2025) - Modern C++20 Implementation:**
I architected and built a complete **real-time trading platform achieving sub-microsecond tick-to-order latency** using C++20. I leveraged advanced C++ features including:
- Concepts and constraints for type-safe template programming
- Coroutines for efficient async I/O without callback hell
- std::atomic and memory ordering for lock-free data structures
- Custom allocators with memory pools for deterministic latency
- Template metaprogramming for compile-time optimizations
- Tracy integration for nanosecond-precision profiling

**At Morgan Stanley (2021-2023) - Smart Order Routing Systems:**
Built **smart order routers for Bovespa, BMV, and TSX exchanges** achieving ~27μs median latency using C++14:
- Implemented FIX protocol handlers using zero-copy techniques
- Developed template-based order type hierarchies for compile-time polymorphism
- Used CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) to eliminate virtual function overhead
- Built lock-free queues using std::atomic for order flow
- Implemented custom STL allocators for hot-path optimization
- Created wash trade detection algorithms using C++ STL algorithms

**At Gemini (2023-2024) - Core System Migration:**
Led critical **migration from Scala to C++** for matching engine and ledger:
- Achieved 10x performance improvement through careful C++ optimization
- Implemented memory-mapped files for persistent state management
- Used SIMD intrinsics for batch order matching
- Developed custom hash maps optimized for order book operations
- Built Kafka integration using modern C++ wrappers (librdkafka++)

**At Edelweiss (2019-2021) - Ultra-Low Latency DMA Platform:**
Maintained **in-house DMA platform with ~200ns latency** using C++14:
- Implemented kernel bypass techniques using C++ for direct hardware access
- Developed zero-allocation hot paths using placement new
- Built custom memory pools with cache-line aligned allocations
- Created template-based message parsing for different exchange protocols
- Used compiler intrinsics for branch prediction hints

**Advanced C++ Techniques I've Mastered:**
- **Memory optimization**: Custom allocators, object pools, arena allocation
- **Template metaprogramming**: SFINAE, variadic templates, fold expressions
- **Lock-free programming**: Compare-and-swap, memory barriers, ABA problem solutions
- **Compile-time optimization**: Constexpr functions, inline assembly where needed
- **Modern features**: Move semantics, perfect forwarding, structured bindings

## 2. Multi-threading and Network Programming Background

### **Extensive Multi-threading Experience**

My entire career has centered on building **highly concurrent, multi-threaded, event-based real-time trading systems** where event coordination and thread-synchronization are critical for achieving microsecond-level performance.

**Practical Real-time Trading Platform Implementations:**
- **AlgoQuant**: Built event-driven architecture with dedicated threads for market data, order management, and risk calculations, all communicating via lock-free queues
- **Morgan Stanley**: Designed thread pools for parallel order routing across multiple exchanges
- **Edelweiss**: Implemented Messaging based reactive-patterns with microsecond-level thread coordination
- **Gemini**: Managed concurrent access to order books using reader-writer locks with writer priority

**Thread Architecture & Synchronization:**
- Designed **thread-per-core architectures** with CPU pinning for deterministic latency
- Implemented **lock-free MPMC/SPSC queues** using atomic operations for inter-thread communication
- Built **wait-free algorithms** for market data distribution to multiple consumers
- Developed **custom spinlocks** optimized for low-contention scenarios
- Used **memory barriers and fences** (std::memory_order_acquire/release) for correct synchronization
- Implemented **hazard pointers** for safe memory reclamation in lock-free structures


### **Deep Network Programming Expertise**

**Low-Level Network Programming:**
- **Raw Socket Programming**: Developed custom **pcap-based latency profiler** at Edelweiss using libpcap++
- **TCP/UDP Optimization**: 
  - Implemented TCP_NODELAY for Nagle algorithm bypass
  - Configured SO_REUSEPORT for multi-threaded UDP receivers
  - Used recvmmsg/sendmmsg for batch packet processing
  - Implemented custom congestion control for reliable UDP

**High-Performance Messaging:**
- **UltraMessaging**: Built pub-sub systems for market data distribution
- **Kafka Integration**: Developed high-throughput producers/consumers with batching
- **RabbitMQ**: Implemented reliable message delivery with custom acknowledgment strategies
- **Protocol Implementation**: Native implementations of FIX, SBE, and proprietary binary protocols

**Network Optimization Techniques:**
- **Kernel Bypass**: Experience with DPDK/RDMA for userspace networking
- **Zero-Copy**: Implemented splice() and sendfile() for efficient data transfer
- **Multicast**: Built reliable multicast systems for market data fan-out
- **Connection Pooling**: Designed efficient connection multiplexing for exchange connectivity
- **Async I/O**: Used epoll/io_uring for handling thousands of concurrent connections

**Exchange Connectivity Experience:**
- Built native connectors for **NSE, Bovespa, BMV, TSX** with microsecond precision
- Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Developed heartbeat mechanisms and sequence number management
- Built gap detection and recovery for reliable market data

**Specific Achievements:**
- **Sub-microsecond tick-to-order** latency requiring precise thread coordination
- **200ns DMA platform** using kernel bypass networking
- **16k TPS distributed ledger** with complex network consensus protocols
- **27μs order routing** with parallel network paths

This multi-threading and network programming expertise is fundamental to every trading system I've built, where microsecond advantages require mastery of concurrent programming and network optimization.

*Note: These skills are clearly demonstrated through my consistent delivery of ultra-low latency systems across multiple financial institutions, with measurable performance metrics that would be impossible without deep expertise in both domains.*
