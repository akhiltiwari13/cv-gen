## **Cover Letter**

Dear Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in Software Engineering position at Decisal. With over 10 years of specialized experience building ultra-low latency systems achieving sub-microsecond performance, I bring deep expertise in designing and optimizing the mission-critical infrastructure that powers modern high-frequency trading.

**Proven Track Record in Ultra-Low Latency Systems**

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered exceptional performance improvements in trading infrastructure:

At **AlgoQuant**, I recently designed and built a complete real-time, event-driven trading platform from the ground up, achieving **sub-microsecond tick-to-order latency** for NSE connectivity. This involved designing the entire stack including OMS, RMS, and exchange gateways, while implementing modern C++20 techniques and Tracy-based instrumentation for nanosecond-level profiling. I also modernized the build infrastructure using Conan 2.0, significantly improving dependency management and build times.

At **Morgan Stanley**, I engineered smart order routers for multiple Latin American exchanges achieving **~27μs median latency**, representing best-in-class performance for these markets. I developed sophisticated order routing algorithms and implemented regulatory compliance features including Beneficiary Ownership Check (BOC) logic for wash trade detection. My comprehensive testing frameworks using Python and Testplan ensured system reliability under extreme load conditions.

At **Edelweiss**, I maintained and optimized an in-house DMA platform achieving **~200ns latency**—pushing the boundaries of software-based trading systems. I developed custom profiling tools using libpcap++ for packet-level analysis and built institutional-grade RMS dashboards with real-time limit monitoring.

**Technical Excellence and Innovation**

My technical expertise spans the entire spectrum required for HFT development:

- **Modern C++ Mastery**: Extensive experience with C++14/17/20, including lock-free programming, cache optimization, and SIMD vectorization
- **Build Systems & DevOps**: Proficient with CMake, Bazel, Conan, Docker, and modern CI/CD pipelines
- **Messaging & Protocols**: Deep expertise in FIX, SBE, Protobuf, and ultra-low latency messaging (UltraMessaging, Kafka)
- **Performance Analysis**: Advanced profiling using Tracy, Valgrind, custom instrumentation, and hardware performance counters
- **Exchange Connectivity**: Hands-on experience with multiple exchange APIs and protocols across global markets

**Full-Stack Trading Systems Understanding**
What distinguishes me is my comprehensive understanding of the entire trading ecosystem. At **Gemini**, I led the critical migration of core services from Scala to C++, achieving 10x performance improvements in the matching engine and ledger systems. At **Barclays**, I developed both back-end APIs and front-end applications, giving me insight into the full application stack and user requirements.

My experience extends beyond traditional finance into blockchain systems, where I designed and implemented a 16k TPS distributed ledger at Deqode, demonstrating my ability to innovate and apply cutting-edge techniques to achieve extreme performance.

**Commitment to Excellence**
I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in trading technology. My approach combines rigorous engineering discipline with creative problem-solving, whether it's achieving nanosecond-level optimizations, implementing novel data structures, or creating systems that scale to millions of messages per second.

I am particularly excited about Decisal's product-suite and believe my proven track record of building world-class trading infrastructure would make me a valuable addition to your team. I am ready to contribute immediately to your most challenging latency and throughput objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my expertise can help Decisal maintain its competitive edge in this ever-evolving world for computing.

Sincerely,  
Akhil Tiwari
