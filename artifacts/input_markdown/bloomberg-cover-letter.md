## **Cover Letter**

Dear Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in Software Engineering position at Bloomberg. With over 10 years of specialized experience building ultra-low latency systems achieving sub-microsecond performance, I bring deep expertise in designing and optimizing the mission-critical infrastructure that powers modern high-frequency trading.

---

**1. Suitability for the Role – Key Skills Alignment**
**Object-Oriented Programming (Python/C++):** I bring 10+ years of intensive C++ development (11 through 20) in performance-critical environments, complemented by strong Python expertise for tooling and automation. At Morgan Stanley, I engineered smart order routers in C++ achieving ~27μs median latency while building comprehensive Python simulation suites that automated 200+ exchange scenarios. My recent work at AlgoQuant involved architecting a complete trading platform in modern C++20 with sub-microsecond performance, while using Python for data analysis and operational tooling.

**Large-Scale Service-Oriented Systems Design:** I have designed and managed end-to-end distributed trading infrastructure serving multiple exchanges globally. At Gemini, I upgraded core services handling millions of daily transactions, improving Ultra Messaging reliability for multicast-based pre-trade risk and ledger systems. My experience spans complete platform architecture – from OMS, RMS, and exchange gateways to feed handlers and matching engines – demonstrating expertise in designing loosely coupled, scalable microservices that operate under extreme load.

**Object-Oriented Design, Data Structures & Systems Programming:** My work consistently demonstrates mastery of advanced OOP principles and systems programming. I implemented lock-free data structures and cache-optimized algorithms achieving ~200ns roundtrip latency at Edelweiss. At Deqode, I designed "Blaze Blockchain Protocol" using Modern C++ with custom data structures to achieve 16K TPS on-chain. I regularly employ design patterns, RAII, template metaprogramming, and memory-efficient data structures to solve complex systems challenges.

**CI/CD and Unit Testing:** I modernized entire build pipelines at AlgoQuant using Conan 2.0 and implemented comprehensive CI/CD workflows with Jenkins and GitHub Actions. At Gemini, I increased test coverage from 20% to 65% across critical services, establishing testing best practices and mentoring teams on Test-Driven Development. My approach integrates unit testing, integration testing, and performance regression testing into every deployment pipeline.

**Scalable Systems with Code Quality, Telemetry & Testing:** I build telemetry-first architectures using industry-leading tools. At AlgoQuant, I integrated Tracy instrumentation for nanosecond-level profiling and feather-trace for event-loop monitoring. At Gemini, I established Datadog monitoring with automated alerts. My systems include comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing from day one. I enforce code quality through code reviews, static analysis with Clang tools, and performance benchmarking, ensuring systems scale reliably while maintaining clean, maintainable codebases.

**2. Reason for Job Change**
My recent roles have been intensive, project-based engagements where I successfully delivered critical platform modernizations. Having now built deep expertise across diverse trading systems – from crypto exchanges to traditional equity markets – I am seeking a long-term opportunity with a technology leader where I can apply my skills at scale. Bloomberg represents the ideal next step: a company where financial technology innovation meets global impact, offering the complexity and scale to fully leverage my specialized experience.

**3. Why Bloomberg**
Bloomberg's reputation as the backbone of global financial markets is compelling. I am particularly drawn to the technical challenge of building systems that process petabytes of market data with microsecond precision, serving millions of financial professionals worldwide. The opportunity to work on infrastructure that influences every corner of finance – from data distribution to analytics platforms – aligns perfectly with my passion for high-performance, large-scale systems. Bloomberg's commitment to engineering excellence and continuous innovation in financial data technology offers the ideal environment to contribute meaningfully while growing alongside the industry's best.

**4. Location Confirmation & Relocation**
**Pune is absolutely suitable and my preferred location.** I am currently based in Delhi and am prepared to relocate immediately for this opportunity. My relocation is driven by both professional and personal factors: Pune's stature as a premier technology hub with a vibrant financial services ecosystem, and the opportunity to join Bloomberg's presence there. I have no constraints preventing relocation and can transition within standard notice periods.

---
I am particularly excited about Bloomberg's product-suite and believe my proven track record of building world-class trading infrastructure would make me a valuable addition to your team.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my expertise can help Bloomberg maintain its competitive edge in this ever-evolving world for computing.

Sincerely,  
Akhil Tiwari
